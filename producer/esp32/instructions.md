# ESP32 source code

As stated in the main README file, the board code was copied from https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-hc-sr04-ultrasonic-arduino/

I have only changed the GPIO pins, as I'm using pins 2 and 4. Copy the cpp code to your Arduino IDE or PlatformIO editor and upload it to your board.

Make sure that everything compiles correctly and the Serial Monitor is correctly displaying the values.

The link also provides the Schematics, but I'll copy them here if you don't want to read through all the page:
